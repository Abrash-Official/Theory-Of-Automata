        <h4 class="mb-3">Formal Statement</h4>
        <p>If a language L is context-free, then there exists some integer p ≥ 1 (called a "pumping length") such that every string s in L that has a length of p or more symbols can be written as s = uvwxy with substrings u, v, w, x and y, such that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>|vx| ≥ 1 (v and x cannot both be empty)</li>
            <li>|vwx| ≤ p (the middle portion has bounded length)</li>
            <li>uv^n wx^n y ∈ L for all n ≥ 0 (pumping property)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Informal Explanation</h4>
        <p>The pumping lemma describes a property that all context-free languages are guaranteed to have. The property applies to all strings in the language that are of length at least p, where p is a constant called the pumping length.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Using the Pumping Lemma</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Assume L is context-free</li>
            <li>Let p be the pumping length</li>
            <li>Choose a string s ∈ L with |s| ≥ p</li>
            <li>Consider all ways to write s = uvwxy satisfying conditions 1 and 2</li>
            <li>For each decomposition, find an n such that uv^n wx^n y ∉ L</li>
            <li>This contradicts condition 3, so L is not context-free</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="mt-4">Example Application</h5>
        <p>The language L = {a^n b^n c^n : n ≥ 1} can be proven not context-free using the pumping lemma, since any attempt to pump will create unequal numbers of a's, b's, and c's.</p>
