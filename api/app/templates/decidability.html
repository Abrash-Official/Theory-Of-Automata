        <h4 class="mb-3">Decidability</h4>
        <p>In logic, a true/false decision problem is <strong>decidable</strong> if there exists an effective method for deriving the correct answer. Logical systems are decidable if membership in their set of logically valid formulas can be effectively determined.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-4">Examples of Decidability</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Propositional logic: Decidable (can use truth-table method)</li>
            <li>First-order logic: Not decidable in general</li>
            <li>Higher-order logic: Also undecidable</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Computability</h4>
        <p>Turing machines provide a precise, formal definition of what it means for a function to be computable. Many other definitions of computation have been proposed, but all known definitions agree on what is computable and what is not.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-4">Church-Turing Thesis</h5>
        <p>The Church-Turing thesis states that every effectively calculable function is computable by a Turing machine. This connects the intuitive notion of algorithm with the formal definition of Turing machine computation.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Undecidable Problems</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Halting problem: Cannot determine if arbitrary Turing machine halts</li>
            <li>Post correspondence problem: Cannot determine if solution exists</li>
            <li>Entscheidungsproblem: Cannot determine validity in first-order logic</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="mt-4">Reduction</h5>
        <p>A problem A is reducible to problem B if solving B would also solve A. If A is undecidable and A reduces to B, then B is also undecidable.</p>
        <h5 class="mt-4">Complexity Classes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>P: Problems solvable in polynomial time</li>
            <li>NP: Problems verifiable in polynomial time</li>
            <li>PSPACE: Problems solvable in polynomial space</li>
            <li>EXPTIME: Problems solvable in exponential time</li>
        </ul>
