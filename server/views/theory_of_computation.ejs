        <p>
            <strong>Theory of Computation</strong> is a field in computer science that helps us understand how computers solve problems, what they can do, and what they cannot do. Here's a simple breakdown so anyone can understand—even if you're new to the topic!
        </p>

        <h5 class="mb-3">1. Automata Theory</h5>
        <p>
            Imagine automata as simple robots or machines that follow rules to recognize patterns, like finding certain words in a document.
        </p>
        <h6>Types of automata:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finite Automata:</strong> Like basic pattern detectors (e.g., searching for a word in text).</li>
            <li><strong>Pushdown Automata:</strong> These have a little memory (like a notepad) to handle more complex patterns, such as checking if parentheses are balanced in code.</li>
            <li><strong>Turing Machines:</strong> The most powerful type—can do any calculation that a computer can do.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why it matters: Automata are used in making compilers (which turn your code into something computers understand) and in language processing.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-3">2. Computability Theory</h5>
        <p>
            This area asks: "Can a computer solve this problem at all?"
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some problems are <strong>decidable</strong> (there's always a solution), while others are <strong>undecidable</strong> (no computer can ever solve them, like predicting if any given program will run forever or stop).</li>
            <li>Turing Machines help us figure out these limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h5 class="mb-3">3. Complexity Theory</h5>
        <p>
            Here, we ask: "How much time or memory does it take for a computer to solve a problem?"
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy problems:</strong> Can be solved quickly (called "P" problems).</li>
            <li><strong>Harder problems:</strong> Solutions can be checked quickly but are hard to find (called "NP" problems).</li>
            <li><strong>Very hard problems:</strong> NP-Complete problems—if you solve one, you can solve them all, but no one knows how to do this quickly yet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helps us make software that runs faster and uses less memory.</p>
