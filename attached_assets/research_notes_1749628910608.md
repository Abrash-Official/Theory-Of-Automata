## Regular Expression to DFA Conversion

### Overview
The main function of regular expressions is to define patterns for matching strings. A common method to construct a DFA from a regular expression is:
1. First construct an NFA from the regex
2. Transform the NFA into equivalent DFA using subset construction
3. However, direct construction from regex to DFA is possible and more efficient

### Direct Construction Algorithm (RegEx → DFA)

**Steps:**
1. **Augmented Regular Expression**: Concatenate unique right-end marker '#' to regex r to create r'
2. **Syntax Tree Construction**: Build syntax tree for r#
3. **Function Evaluation**: Calculate four functions:
   - `nullable(n)`: true if regex represented by n has ε in its language
   - `firstpos(n)`: set of positions that can match first symbol
   - `lastpos(n)`: set of positions that can match last symbol
   - `followpos(i)`: set of positions that can follow position i

**Rules for Computing Functions:**

| Node n | nullable(n) | firstpos(n) | lastpos(n) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Leaf labeled ε | true | ∅ | ∅ |
| Leaf labeled with position i | false | {i} | {i} |
| OR node (c1\|c2) | nullable(c1) OR nullable(c2) | firstpos(c1) ∪ firstpos(c2) | lastpos(c1) ∪ lastpos(c2) |
| CAT node (c1c2) | nullable(c1) AND nullable(c2) | If nullable(c1) then firstpos(c1) ∪ firstpos(c2) else firstpos(c1) | If nullable(c2) then lastpos(c2) ∪ lastpos(c1) else lastpos(c2) |
| STAR node (c1*) | true | firstpos(c1) | lastpos(c1) |

**Followpos Rules:**
1. If n is cat-node with children c1, c2 and i ∈ lastpos(c1), then firstpos(c2) ⊆ followpos(i)
2. If n is star-node and i ∈ lastpos(n), then firstpos(n) ⊆ followpos(i)

4. **DFA Construction**: 
   - Start state = firstpos(root)
   - Accepting states = those containing position of endmarker '#'
   - Build transition table using followpos

### Example: (a|b)*abb
- Augmented: (a|b)*abb#
- Start state: {1,2,3}
- Accepting state: contains position 6 (for #)

**Transition Table:**
| State | a | b |
|-------|---|---|
| A{1,2,3} | B{1,2,3,4} | A{1,2,3} |
| B{1,2,3,4} | B{1,2,3} | C{1,2,3,5} |
| C{1,2,3,5} | B{1,2,3,4} | D{1,2,3,6} |
| D{1,2,3,6} | B{1,2,3,4} | A{1,2,3} |

Where D is the accepting state.




## NFA to DFA Conversion (Subset Construction Algorithm)

### Overview
An NFA can have zero, one or more moves from a given state on a given input symbol. An NFA can also have NULL moves (ε-transitions). DFA has one and only one move from a given state on a given input symbol.

### Subset Construction Algorithm Steps:

**Step 1: Convert NFA to transition table**
- List all states, input symbols, and transition rules
- Represent as matrix: rows = current state, columns = input symbol, cells = next state

**Step 2: Create DFA's start state**  
- DFA start state = ε-closure of NFA's start state
- ε-closure = set of all states reachable by following ε-transitions

**Step 3: Create DFA's transition table**
- Rows and columns represent sets of states (not individual states)
- For each input symbol, cell contains ε-closure of states obtained by following NFA transitions

**Step 4: Create DFA's final states**
- DFA final states = sets of states containing at least one NFA final state

**Step 5: Simplify the DFA**
- Remove unreachable states (cannot be reached from start state)
- Remove dead states (cannot lead to final state)  
- Merge equivalent states (same transition rules for all input symbols)

**Step 6: Repeat until no further simplification possible**

### Example: NFA with states {q0, q1, q2}

**Original NFA Transition Table:**
| State | a | b |
|-------|---|---|
| q0 | {q0,q1} | {q0} |
| q1 | ∅ | {q2} |
| q2 | ∅ | ∅ |

**DFA Construction Process:**
1. Start state: {q0}
2. δ'({q0}, a) = {q0,q1}, δ'({q0}, b) = {q0}
3. New state {q0,q1} added
4. δ'({q0,q1}, a) = {q0,q1}, δ'({q0,q1}, b) = {q0,q2}
5. New state {q0,q2} added
6. δ'({q0,q2}, a) = {q0,q1}, δ'({q0,q2}, b) = {q0}

**Final DFA Transition Table:**
| State | a | b |
|-------|---|---|
| {q0} | {q0,q1} | {q0} |
| {q0,q1} | {q0,q1} | {q0,q2} |
| {q0,q2} | {q0,q1} | {q0} |

Final state: {q0,q2} (contains q2 from original NFA)


## DFA to Regular Expression Conversion (State Elimination Algorithm)

### Overview
Any DFA can be converted into a regular expression using the state elimination method. The process involves creating a generalized NFA and systematically removing states until only initial and final states remain.

### State Elimination Algorithm Steps:

**Step A: Convert DFA to Generalized NFA**
- Add new initial state with ε-transition to old initial state
- Add new final state with ε-transitions from all old final states
- Allow regular expressions on edges (not just symbols)

**Step B: Remove intermediate states one-by-one**
- For each state to be eliminated, reroute all paths through it
- Replace paths going through eliminated state with direct transitions

**Step C: Output the final regular expression**
- When only initial and final states remain, the label on the single transition is the regex

### State Elimination Process Details:

**Ripping out a state qrip:**
1. Identify all states qi that have transitions to qrip
2. Identify all states qj that qrip has transitions to  
3. For each pair (qi, qj), create new direct transition with regex:
   
   **R = Rin(Rrip)*Rout**
   
   Where:
   - Rin = regex from qi to qrip
   - Rrip = regex for self-loop on qrip  
   - Rout = regex from qrip to qj

**Combining parallel transitions:**
If there are multiple transitions between same states, combine using union:
**Rdir + Rin(Rrip)*Rout**

### Example Process:
1. Start with DFA
2. Add new initial and final states
3. Systematically eliminate intermediate states
4. Update transition labels using the formula above
5. Final regex is the label on the remaining transition

### Key Formula:
For eliminating state qrip between qi and qj:
**New transition label = Rin(Rrip)*Rout**

This process reduces the automaton by one state each iteration until only two states remain connected by the final regular expression.
